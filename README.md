# Digit Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark in the machine-learning community, consisting of thousands of labelled images of handwritten digits.

## Objectives
- To preprocess the MNIST dataset for training and testing.
- To design and implement a CNN model for digit classification.
- To evaluate the model's performance and accuracy on the test dataset.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
